# Petri Net
This is an example Design studio aimed for developers relatively new to the [WebGME](https://webgme.org) platform based off of [StateMachineJoint](https://github.com/kecso/StateMachineJoint).
It allows model editing, simulation, and some limited model-checking functionality.
The studio implements the Petri Net domain.
For its special simulator visualization, it uses the [JointJS](https://www.jointjs.com/) javascript library.

## Installation
In Ubuntu with docker installed, run `docker-compose up -d`
Finally, navigate to `http://localhost:8888` to start using the PetriNet!
Run `docker-compose stop` to stop the simulation
